** Overall Ideas **
- Models to predict player performance
    - Problem: Rookies | Solution A: Separate model for rookies
    - Problem: Injuries | Solution A: Predict PPG instead of overall points
    - Problem: Situation Changes
        - Sub-Problem: QB change | Solution: Use data from new QB's previous season
        - Sub-Problem: Coach Change
    - Problem: How to factor training camp hype | Solution: Not totally sure, hopefully it is somewhat reflected in the depth chart.
- Reinforcement Learning model to train draft agent to converge on ideal draft position/strategy given player ppg rankings
    - Problem: Need actually accurate Draft Simulator to be able to integrate the Draft Agent | Solution A: Create yourself, Solution B: Use dataset of drafts
- NEED TO LOOK INTO POINTS OVER REPLACEMENT STATISTIC
- Create a Consistency metric, based on player availability, standard deviation of points/usage, likelihood of bust week
- Data analysis on Trending Up players
- Waiver value analyzer
