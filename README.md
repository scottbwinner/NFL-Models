Need projected draft order: https://www.fantasypros.com/nfl/adp/ppr-overall.php?year=2024

Problems
1. Rookies
2. Injuries
    - Could do most previous non injured season
    - Need to do everything per game
3. New teams
4. New coaches/schemes

** Overall Ideas **
- WR Models
- RB Models
- TE Models
- QB Models
- Maybe it would be interesting to value players by projected points above average (of position) and then have the AI do mock drafts to look at the strategy?
